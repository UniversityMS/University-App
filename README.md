# University-App

University Management System fully responsive user interface and built to support 2 types of users login system for administrator and lecturer. Admin can can add/delete/edit
employees, students, events. Lecturer is able to add/delete/edit students marks and observe list of employees and students, and see details of each employee and student. 

It is CRUD java application using Spring Boot framework with Spring Security and MySQL database. For frontend tools we used Thymeleafe, html, css and Bootstrap.

We created Global Data Base host on db4free.net.

Also password and username is generating automatically after adding new user in system. And password is encrypted.


Future imrovements that can be done in this project: add more acces levels, for students who will ba able to check their marks, search marks by subject and see who edit mark and
the date when submitted. Add posobility for lecturers to mark attendance. Make information about events more interactive and nice looking, maybe like a calender.
